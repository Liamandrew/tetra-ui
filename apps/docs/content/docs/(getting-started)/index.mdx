## Why tetra-ui?

### The shadcn/ui Philosophy for React Native

Much like shadcn/ui revolutionized web development, tetra-ui brings the same principles to React Native:

- **No Black Box**: You own the code completely - no hidden dependencies or magic
- **Copy & Customize**: Copy components directly into your project and modify as needed
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any React Native setup, not tied to specific frameworks
- **Community Driven**: Open source and community-focused development

## Universal vs Mobile-Only

Many component libraries aim for "write once, run anywhere" - creating universal components that work on both web and mobile. While this approach has its merits, tetra-ui takes a different stance:

**We believe in purpose-built tools over universal compromises.**

Universal libraries often make tradeoffs in:
- **Design**: Components that look good on web but feel awkward on mobile
- **Performance**: Optimizations that work for web but hurt mobile performance
- **User Experience**: Interactions designed for mouse that don't translate to touch
- **Platform Integration**: Missing out on platform-specific features and conventions

tetra-ui is crafted specifically for mobile, ensuring:
- **Native Feel**: Components that feel like they belong on mobile devices
- **Touch Optimization**: Interactions designed for fingers, not cursors
- **Platform Awareness**: Respects iOS and Android design patterns
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile hardware and constraints
